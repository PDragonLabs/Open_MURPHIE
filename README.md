# Open MURPHIE

Open MURPHIE (Multi Use Robotic Platform Humanoid Intelligent Entity) is an early-stage open-source project aimed at creating real-life droids akin to R2D2, C3P0, or Commander Data. The project is in its nascent stage and we are actively seeking contributors and sponsors to help bring this vision to life.

## Project Goals

The ultimate goal of Open_MURPHIE is to provide an open-source alternative to platforms like Boston Dynamics and Tesla's Optimus. We aim to create a versatile robotic platform that can be used in a variety of applications, from digital assistants in the cloud to smart home devices or even embodied in robots.

This project runs parallel to the [https://github.com/daveshap/ACE_Framework](ACE Framework) (Autonomous Cognitive Entity), a universal and extensible cognitive architecture designed to create fully autonomous agents. The long-term vision is to integrate the ACE Framework with Open_MURPHIE, creating a comprehensive solution for autonomous robotics.

## How to Contribute

We are currently seeking the following expertise:

- Mechanical Engineering: Particularly those experienced with robotics, rapid prototyping, open source projects, and additive manufacturing.
- Electrical Engineering: Particularly those familiar with sensorimotor feedback loops, actuation, and embedded systems.
- Machine Learning/AI: Most especially open source models, vision models, and multimodal models.
- Animatronics/Mechatronics: Creating friendly, lifelike machines that are pleasing to work with.
- Product Specialists: This includes people familiar with manufacturing, design, sourcing, financing, and so on.

If you have expertise in any of these areas and are interested in contributing to the project, please get in touch.

## Sponsorship

Open_MURPHIE is also open to sponsorships. If you or your organization are interested in sponsoring this project, please contact us for more information.

## Current State of the Project

Open_MURPHIE is in its early stages. We have just announced the project and are in the process of gathering a team and resources. We will update this section as the project progresses.
